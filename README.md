## About

This project demonstrates modern web development techniques, focusing on parallax scrolling and z-axis visual storytelling using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features

- Interactive parallax effects
- Multi-layered z-axis animations
- Responsive design

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended: v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- (For backend) Additional dependencies as required by your backend (e.g., Express, Flask, etc.)

## Getting Started (Frontend)

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SchokaJoka/DEWEB_Project.git
   cd DEWEB_Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies (if applicable):**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   _If there is no `package.json`, you can skip this step._

3. **Start the frontend project:**

   - If there is a build/start script:

     ```sh
     npm start
     ```

   - If not, simply open the main HTML file (usually `index.html`) in your browser.

## Starting the Backend Server

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```

   _Replace `backend` with the actual backend folder name, if different._

2. **Install backend dependencies:**

   - For Node.js/Express:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```
   - For Python/Flask:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Start the backend server:**

   - For Node.js/Express:
     ```sh
     npm start
     ```
     _or_
     ```sh
     node index.js
     ```
   - For Python/Flask:
     ```sh
     python app.py
     ```

   _Refer to your backendâ€™s README or main file for the correct start command._

4. **The backend server typically runs on `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5000` by default. Update the frontend if a different port or address is used._

## Usage

- Open the website in your browser.
- Scroll and interact with the page to experience the parallax and z-axis effects.
- Edit the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files to customize the effects.
