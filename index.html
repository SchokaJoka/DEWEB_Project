                    <p class="decade-description">
                        The 1980s marked the explosive birth of hip-hop culture in the Bronx, New York. 
                        DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, and Grandmaster Flash pioneered the turntable techniques 
                        that would define the genre. This decade saw the rise of legendary groups like 
                        Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys, who brought hip-hop from underground block parties 
                        to mainstream radio and MTV.

                        The 90s are widely considered hip-hop's golden age, bringing us legendary artists 
                        like Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Nas, and Jay-Z. The East Coast-West Coast 
                        rivalry defined much of the decade, while innovative producers like Dr. Dre 
                        created the G-Funk sound. Groups like Wu-Tang Clan revolutionized both the music 
                        and business side of hip-hop.

                        The 2000s saw hip-hop fully dominate mainstream culture. Eminem became the 
                        best-selling rapper of all time, while Jay-Z and Kanye West redefined what 
                        it meant to be a hip-hop mogul. The South rose to prominence with artists 
                        like OutKast and Lil Wayne, while producers like Timbaland and The Neptunes 
                        created innovative sounds that influenced pop music globally.

                        The 2010s brought a digital revolution to hip-hop. Streaming platforms like 
                        Spotify and Apple Music changed how music was consumed, while social media 
                        transformed artist-fan relationships. Drake dominated the charts, Kendrick Lamar 
                        won a Pulitzer Prize, and new subgenres like trap and mumble rap emerged. 
                        Hip-hop officially became the most popular music genre in America.
